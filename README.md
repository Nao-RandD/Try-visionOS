# Try-visionOS

Welcome to the visionOS Documentation Project! This repository contains code examples and resources based on Apple's official visionOS documentation. The primary goal of this project is to enhance your understanding of visionOS by providing practical code samples that you can run and experiment with.

We have placed the code to be presented at this event below.

[Session 1](https://vision-os.connpass.com/event/293186/

## Resources

- Official visionOS Documentation: [Apple visionOS Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/visionos/creating-your-first-visionos-app)

## About visionOS

visionOS is a cutting-edge technology developed by Apple that focuses on computer vision and visual recognition tasks. This powerful framework allows developers to create applications that can analyze and interpret visual data, enabling a wide range of use cases from image recognition to augmented reality.

## Project Goals

The main objective of this project is to facilitate your learning process by providing hands-on experience with visionOS. By exploring and running the code examples provided here, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how visionOS works and how you can leverage its capabilities in your own projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the visionOS Documentation Project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Nao-RandD/Try-visionOS.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to Code Examples:** Once you have the repository cloned, explore the `code-examples` directory. Here, you'll find a collection of code snippets and sample projects that demonstrate various features of visionOS.

3. **Run the Code:** Feel free to open the code examples in your preferred development environment and run them. Experiment with different parameters, inputs, and scenarios to see how visionOS behaves in different situations.

4. **Learn and Modify:** As you run the code and observe the results, take note of how visionOS processes visual data and provides insights. Use this knowledge to modify and adapt the code examples for your own projects.
